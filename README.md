# Branch
- What is Branching?
    - Unlike other VCS which could be a heavy process to create a branch, Git has a lightweight method when it comes to branching. By creating a branch, you are creating a non static pointer to one of the commits.
    - The main purpose of branching is to work separately from the main development branch such as **main/master**.

## create
- A new movable pointer (branch) can be created by using **git branch** command:
`$ git branch B`
by doing so, a branch named **B** has been created.
