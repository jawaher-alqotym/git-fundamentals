# Git-Fundamentals

# What is Git?
Git is a DevOps tool used for file management enabling multiple developers to work together created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in any type of files like source code files.

Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, think of it as if Git takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.

## The Three States of Git
Files in Git can be in one of three following states: WT (working tree), staging, or committed.

### 1) Working Tree

In this stage, you can do whatever you need to the files that exist in the project folder directory. Think of it as the working space where you create, edit, and delete files/file's content and folders.</br>If you need to view the differences between the working tree and the indexed file (files that wore moved to the next [stage](https://github.com/jawaher-alqotym/git-fundamentals/blob/section-A/README.md#2-staging-git-add) ). Git provides you with the command [git status](https://github.com/jawaher-alqotym/git-fundamentals/blob/section-A/README.md#git-status). note here that git compears the working tree with the database residing in .git file when git status is called.

### 2) Staging: Git Add

The staging area sometimes referred to as "index" is a file that resides in your Git directory and contains details about the content of your upcoming commit. To move files to this stage use one of the following commands.

```
git add <file-name>
```
```
git add <.../file-name>
```
```
git add .
```

### 3) DB: Git Commit
